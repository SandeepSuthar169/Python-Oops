1. Class and Obj 
2. Class has data or attribure, func or methods
   > attributes get called itself and method are called manually
   > everything in python is an object (data structure, data type ...)

3. Advantages of oops  
   > you can create your own datatype. 
   > code reusability.
   > dubugging
   > easy to colab

4. End ot end project (chaetbook class) 
   > function and method 
   > magic method and dunder method 
   > self
   > You can create attribure outside class as well
   > encapsulation 
   > getter and setter
   > static method

5. Inheritance
   > code reusability, pareht has no access to child class
   > Constructor, Non privete attribure, Non privete methods
   > constructor overloading  &  method overloading
   >Super keyword (can be used only inside class, can not access variables/attribures, used only insidechild class)
